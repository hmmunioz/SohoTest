# Task Management Application

This is a Flutter-based task management application that helps users organize their tasks by adding, filtering, and completing them. It follows a structured architecture for better maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title and completion status.
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Completed**, or **Pending**.
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- Pagination support for tasks.
- Integrated with `BLoC` for state management.
- Unit-tested using `bloc_test` and `mockito`.

Manages the business logic and state for tasks.

- **Events**:

  - `ChangeFilterEvent`

- **States**:
  - `TaskStateEnum.initial`

  - `TaskStateEnum.error`

### TaskEntity

Represents a task in the application with the following fields:
