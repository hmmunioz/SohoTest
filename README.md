## Features

- Add tasks with a title and completion status.
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Completed**, or **Pending**.
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- Pagination support for tasks.
- Integrated with `BLoC` for state management.
- Unit-tested using `bloc_test` and `mockito`.

  - `CompleteOrUncompleteTaskEvent`
  - `ChangeFilterEvent`
  - `CurrentTaskEvent`

- **States**:
  - `TaskStateEnum.initial`
  - `TaskStateEnum.loading`
  - `TaskStateEnum.loaded`
  - `TaskStateEnum.error`

### TaskEntity

Represents a task in the application with the following fields:
